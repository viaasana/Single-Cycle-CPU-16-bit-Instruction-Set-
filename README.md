# Single-Cycle-CPU-16-bit-Instruction-Set-
This project implements a single-cycle CPU with a custom 16-bit instruction set architecture (ISA). It supports arithmetic, logic, shift, jump, and I/O operations, making it a good example of how a processor fetches, decodes, and executes instructions in hardware.  The design is written in Verilog HDL and verified with a testbench.
